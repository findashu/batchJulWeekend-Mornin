        Instamojo payments work by creating request URLs which can accept payments. Creating a request is as simple as passing an amount and a purpose. This step generates a Payment Request ID.

        Once a request is created, you can use the request URL to accept a payment in your mobile app, website or application.
        
        Using the Payment Request ID you can display a payment form to your customers. Your customer can choose a payment method of their choice and make a payment. Once a payment is made, you will receive a Payment ID.
